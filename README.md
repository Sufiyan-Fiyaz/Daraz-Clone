# 🛍️ Daraz Clone — Frontend (with Backend Integration)

A complete **Daraz.pk clone** built to replicate the core features of an e-commerce platform —  
including product listings, cart system, search functionality, authentication, and order management.  
This repository contains the **frontend code**, while the **backend** (connected to a database)  
is developed and stored privately for security reasons.
